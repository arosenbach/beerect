# Beerect

Beerect is the result of a coding challenge. The goal was to create a Web application, without using any third-party framework, that fullfills following requirements :

* user must be able to draw rectangles of random colors using the mouse.
* when double-clicking on a rectangle it does a 360Â° rotation and disappears once the rotation's done.
* when double-clicking on a multiple rectangles, all the rotations must be done before removing the rectangles.
